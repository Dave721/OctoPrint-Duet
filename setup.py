# Some custom command to run during setup. The command is not essential for this
# workflow. It is used here as an example. Each command will spawn a child
# process. Typically, these commands will include steps to install non-Python
# packages. For instance, to install a C++-based library libjpeg62 the following
# two commands will have to be added:
#
#     ['apt-get', 'update'],
#     ['apt-get', '--assume-yes', 'install', 'libjpeg62'],
#
# First, note that there is no need to use the sudo command because the setup
# script runs with appropriate access.
# Second, if apt-get tool is used then the first command needs to be 'apt-get
# update' so the tool refreshes itself and initializes links to download
# repositories.  Without this initial step the other apt-get install commands
# will fail with package not found errors. Note also --assume-yes option which
# shortcuts the interactive confirmation.
#
# Note that in this example custom commands will run after installing required
# packages. If you have a PyPI package that depends on one of the custom
# commands, move installation of the dependent package to the list of custom
# commands, e.g.:
#
#     ['pip', 'install', 'my_package'],
#
# TODO(BEAM-3237): Output from the custom commands are missing from the logs.
# The output of custom commands (including failures) will be logged in the
# worker-startup log.
